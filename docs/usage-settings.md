## Slack section

```
[slack]
hookURL      = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/abc123/defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
#legacyToken  = "xoxp-11111111111-222222222222-3333333333"
channel      = "#channel-name"
#channel      = "${servername}"
iconEmoji    = ":ghost:"
authUser     = "username"
notifyUsers  = ["@username"]
```

- hookURL or legacyToken.  
If there are a lot of vulnerabilities, it is better to use legacyToken since the Slack notification will be flooded.

- hookURL : Incoming webhook's URL (hookURL is ignored when legacyToken is set.)  
![Vuls-slack](/img/docs/vuls-slack-en.png)

- legacyToken : slack legacy token (https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)  
![Vuls-slack-thread](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8997330/31842418-02b703f2-b629-11e7-8ec3-beda5d3a397e.png)

- channel : channel name. 
If you set `${servername}` to channel, the report will be sent to each channel.  
In the following example, the report will be sent to the `#server1` and `#server2`.  
Be sure to create these channels before scanning.
```
[slack]
channel      = "${servername}"
...snip...

[servers]

[servers.server1]
host         = "172.31.4.82"
...snip...

[servers.server2]
host         = "172.31.4.83"
...snip...
```

- iconEmoji: emoji
- authUser: username of the slack team
- notifyUsers: a list of Slack usernames to send Slack notifications.
If you set `["@foo", "@bar"]` to notifyUsers, @foo @bar will be included in text.  
So @foo, @bar can receive mobile push notifications on their smartphone.  

## EMail section

```
[email]
smtpAddr      = "smtp.gmail.com"
smtpPort      = "587"
user          = "username"
password      = "password"
from          = "from@address.com"
to            = ["to@address.com"]
cc            = ["cc@address.com"]
subjectPrefix = "[vuls]"
```

## Syslog section

```
[syslog]
protocol    = "tcp"
host        = "localhost"
port        = "514"
tag         = "vuls"
facility    = "local0"
severity    = "alert"
verbose     = false
```

- protocol : transfer protocol (default: empty)
- `tcp` or `udp` or empty  
 If protocol is empty, vuls will connect to the local syslog server.
- host : syslog target host 
- domain name or IP address
- port : syslog target port (default: 514) 
- tag : syslog tag
- facility : syslog facility (default: `auth`)  
- kern, user, mail, daemon, etc.
- severity : syslog severity (default: `info`) 
- emerg, alert, crit, etc.
- verbose : verbose mode  (default: false)
- CVE detail, etc.



## Default section

```
[default]
#port        = "22"
#user        = "username"
#keyPath     = "/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa"
#cpeNames = [
#  "cpe:/a:rubyonrails:ruby_on_rails:4.2.1",
#]
#ignoreCves = ["CVE-2016-6313"]
#optional = [
#    ["key", "value"],
#]
```
Items of the default section will be used if not specified.

## servers section

```
[servers]

[servers.172-31-4-82]
host         = "172.31.4.82"
#port        = "22"
#user        = "root"
#keyPath     = "/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa"
#type 		 = "pseudo"
#cpeNames = [
#  "cpe:/a:rubyonrails:ruby_on_rails:4.2.1",
#]
#ignoreCves = ["CVE-2016-6314"]
#optional = [
#    ["key", "value"],
#]
#[servers.172-31-4-82.containers]
#type = "lxd" # or "docker" or "lxc"
#includes = ["${running}"]
#excludes = ["container_name", "container_id"]
```

You can overwrite the default value specified in default section.  

- host: IP address or hostname of target server
- port: SSH Port number
- user: SSH username
- keyPath: SSH private key path
- type: "pseudo" for non-ssh scanning. see [#531](https://github.com/future-architect/vuls/pull/531)
- cpeNames: see [Usage: Scan vulnerability of non-OS package](usage-scan-non-os-packages.md)
- ignoreCves: CVE IDs that will not be reported. But output to JSON file.
- optional: Add additional information to JSON report.
- containers: see [Example: Scan containers (Docker/LXD)(usage-scan.md#example-scan-containers-docker-lxd-lxc)

Vuls supports two types of SSH. One is external command. The other is native go implementation. For details, see [-ssh-native-insecure option](usage-scan.md#ssh-native-insecure-option)

Multiple SSH authentication methods are supported.  
- SSH agent
- SSH public key authentication (with password and empty password)
Password authentication is not supported.
