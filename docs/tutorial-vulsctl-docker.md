## Vulsctl Tutorial

[Vuls](https://github.com/future-architect/vuls) is an agent-less vulnerability scanner for Linux, FreeBSD, Container, WordPress, Programming language libraries, Network devices.

This tutorial explains how to perform a vulnerability scan using [Vulsctl](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl), an easy setup tool for Vuls.

- Scan Host OS (CentOS) vulnerabilities
- Scan Ubuntu via SSH
- Application-dependent library vulnerability scan
- CPE Scanning of Network Device OS

Vuls provides a Docker image on DockerHub. This tutorial is a tutorial on scanning with the official Vuls image; the official Docker Hub repository is [here](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/vuls/repositories).

---

## Environmental Settings

Prepare one Linux machine for the Vuls setup.
Any major Linux will work.

The following spec is recommended.

- Disk: About 15 GB is enough.
- ~~4GB or more of memory is recommended.~~
  - ~~Vulnerability DB (NVD) fetch consumes about 2.5 GB of memory.~~
  - ~~If it's not enough, it will be out of memory.~~
  - ~~t3.medium is fine (AWS EC2).~~
  - Since [go-cve-dictionary-v0.8.1](https://github.com/vulsio/go-cve-dictionary/releases/tag/v0.8.1), memory consumption has been reduced, You can use a smaller instance.

In this tutorial, we will use CentOS 7 as an example.

Install git by connecting to it via SSH.

```bash
$ sudo yum install git
```

Next, install Docker and configure it so that you can run the docker command without root privileges.

  - https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
  - https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

Clone [vulsio/vulsctl](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl), which is full of useful scripts. You can clone it anywhere, but this time you will clone it to `$HOME/vulsctl`

```bash
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl.git
Cloning into 'vuls-vulsctl'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 14, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
remote: Total 14 (delta 4), reused 12 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (14/14), done.
```

If you have previously set up vulsctl, update it to the latest version.

```bash
$ cd vulsctl
$ git pull
```

The rest of the operations are done in the **vulsctl/docker**.

```bash
$ cd docker
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
```

## Scan Host OS (CentOS) vulnerabilities

---

### Configuring SSH Public Key Authentication.

To scan from the Vuls Docker container via SSH to the host OS, you need to configure SSH.

Vuls `remote scan mode` only supports SSH public key authentication.
Create a key pair and SSH to the server to be scanned beforehand. To register the fingerprint of the server to be scanned in `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts`.
This time, create a key with no password. Make sure you can SSH without a password prompt.
If you see the password prompt, you can't scan, so you need to review your SSH settings and configure your SSH to use public key authentication with no password.
If you need to use a key with password, see the tips of [Scan in Docker container](tips.md#scan-in-docker-container)

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -q -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
$ ssh vuls@192.168.56.3
$ exit
```

---

### Creating config.toml

Next, you need to prepare a configuration file.

Vuls uses the TOML configuration file, `config.toml`, to configure the server to be scanned, and so on. A template for remote scanning can be found in [here](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl/blob/master/config.toml.remotescan). 
You can define multiple servers to scan in config.toml. In this case, only one server is defined.
In config.toml, you can set up the information needed to SSH to the server you want to scan.

- IP address
- SSH port number
- User Name
- Private Key for SSH

For details of config.toml, please refer to [Manual](https://vuls.io/docs/en/config.toml.html).

```bash
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
$ cat config.toml 
[servers]
[servers.host]
host        = "192.168.56.3"
port        = "22"
user        = "vuls"
keyPath     = "/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

Note that this tutorial is a Docker-based setup, so be careful with the keyPath in config.toml.
The keyPath is not the path in Host OS, but the path in the Docker container.
In [vulsctl/scan.sh](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl/blob/master/docker/scan.sh#L19), we have mounted it as `-v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro`, so the The path in the container, /root/.ssh/ir_rsa.

---

### Scan

Now, let's run the scan using the configuration file we prepared earlier.

[vulsctl/scan.sh](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl/blob/master/docker/scan.sh) is a script to scan based on the information set in config.toml. The scan results will be stored in JSON format under `$PWD/results` and will be used when reporting. You can specify the server to be scanned by the command line arguments. Since `host` is specified as command-line args, the server [servers.host] defined in config.toml will be scanned.

Vuls uses the SSH information defined in config.toml to SSH to the server to be scanned and issue commands on it.
There are several scanning modes, but in this case, the default [fast scan mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-fast-scan.html) will be used as we haven't specified anything in config.toml.

```bash
$ pwd

### Fetch OVAL DB

Next, fetch the vulnerability DB in the OVAL format provided by Linux distributors.

As we have scanned CentOS this time, we will fetch it with ``--redhat``; for other distributions such as Ubuntu, you can fetch it with the corresponding option. For more information about options, please refer to the following page.

### report

Now that the vulnerability DB is ready. Run the report.

Use [vulsctl/report.sh](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl/blob/master/docker/report.sh) to display the results.
Identify potential CVE-IDs in the server to be scanned using the information in the JSON created by scan.sh and the OVAL provided by Red Hat, which we fetched earlier.
See [documentation](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-report.html) for details.

### TUI

Vuls has a terminal-based viewer that allows you to view the results in the terminal. Let's try it out here.

Use [vulsctl/tui.sh](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl/blob/master/docker/tui.sh) to view the results in the console. Tab to move the pane, arrow or jk to move it, and Ctrl-C to exit.

See [documentation](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-tui.html) for details.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
$ ./tui.sh --cvss-over=7
```

## Scan Ubuntu

Vuls can easily scan for vulnerabilities on any SSH-enabled  remote Linux/FreeBSD.

Prepare a Ubuntu server and set up an SSH public key authentication and run SSH once before the scan.

Next, add the SSH information of the Ubuntu server to the configuration file for the scan.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
$ cat config.toml
[servers]
[servers.ubuntu]
host        = "192.168.56.4"
port        = "22"
user        = "vuls"
keyPath     = "/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

Perform a scan.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
$ ./scan.sh ubuntu
```

The report requires an additional Vulnerability DB for Ubuntu (OVAL).

```bash
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
$ ./oval.sh --ubuntu
$ ./report.sh
$ ./tui.sh
```

If you scan other Linux distributions, please prepare a corresponding OVAL in advance as well. Please refer to the documentation for details.

- [vulsctl/docker/oval.sh](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl/blob/master/docker/oval.sh)

## Show not-fixed-yet vulnerabilities

There are a number of vulnerabilities for which CVE-IDs have been issued, but no update package is available(henceforth referred to as `not-fixed-yet vulnerability`), and Vuls can also detect `not-fixed-yet vulnerability`.

To detect these vulnerabilities, you need an additional vulnerability database.
Use the following command to obtain the vulnerability DB using [vulsio/gost](https://github.com/vulsio/gost).

gost only supports Red Hat, CentOS, and Debian. For other OS, fetching gost's DB does not affect the detection accuracy.
However, it is recommended to fetch gost to add CVSS and Summary information, because Red Hat CVE information is rich and useful.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
$ ./gost.sh --redhat

## Show PoC/Exploit (Metasploit Framework)

Reports can show whether Exploit for detected CVE-IDs is in [Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/). A CVE with an attack module is considered to be easily attackable by the tool, so the risk is higher than a CVE without an attack module.

## Show PoC/Exploit (Exploit Database)

The [Exploit Database](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb/) has collected over 43,000 PoCs. 

Vuls can show if a PoC exists for each CVE-ID detected by Vuls, which means that vulnerabilities with a PoC are riskier than those without. However, it is unclear whether the PoC detected is a works fine or not, so it needs to be verified by the user.

Fetch [go-exploitdb](https://github.com/vulsio/go-exploitdb).

## Scan in fast-root mode

The [fast-root](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-fast-root-scan.html) scan mode issues commands that require root privileges. This allows you to display process information, and network port listen information, and other information useful in making triage decisions.

```bash
[vuls@host vulsctl]$ sudo su -
[sudo] vuls password:
[root@host ~]# mkdir .ssh
[root@host ~]# chmod 700 .ssh
[root@host ~]# cat /home/vuls/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
[root@host ~]# chmod 600 /root/.ssh/*
[root@host ~]# exit
```

Check if you can connect to SSH as a root user without a password.

```bash
[vuls@host vulsctl]$ ssh root@192.168.56.3
Last login: Mon Jan 27 13:15:06 2020
[root@host ~]# exit
```

The root user can connect to SSH without a password.

Next, add the following to config.toml.
The following is added to config.toml: `scanMode = ["fast-root"]` to specify the fast-root mode.

```bash
[servers]
[servers.hostroot]
host         = "192.168.56.3"
port        = "22"
user        = "root"
keyPath     = "/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
scanMode     = ["fast-root"]
```

Scan and report.

```bash
$ ./scan.sh hostroot
$ ./report.sh
$ ./tui.sh
```

The TUI now displays process, and network port listen information.
You can now see if a process is running from a vulnerable package, including CVE, and if the process is listening to a network port. You can now make a decision to investigate if a process that is vulnerable to a network-based attack is listening to the network.

![port](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/534611/60597057-36902a00-9de5-11e9-9d9c-3187176755a3.png)

In fast-root scan mode, additional OS packages may need to be installed in advance. Also, if you use sudo instead of root user, you need to set up /etc/sudoers on the server to be scanned.
Please refer to [documentation](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-fast-scan.html#dependencies-and-etcsudoers) for details.

---

## Offline scan mode

There is also an [offline](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-configtest.html#fast-root-scan-mode) mode that allows you to scan even if the server you want to scan cannot connect to the Internet. Configure toml as follows.

```bash
[servers]
[servers.hostroot]
host         = "192.168.56.3"
port        = "22"
user        = "root"
keyPath     = "/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
scanMode     = ["fast", "offline"]
```

## Application library vulnerability detection

Vuls supports scanning for application dependency libraries.

There are several ways to do this, and it's better to try them out as they may not be suitable for your needs.

- [LockFile Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#library-vulns-scan)
- [GitHub Integration](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#usage-integrate-with-github-security-alerts)
- [OWASP Dependency check](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#usage-integrate-with-owasp-dependency-check-to-automatic-update-when-the-libraries-are-updated-experimental)

See [Document](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html) for details.

The next section explains how to scan with a lock file.

---

## Application library vulnerability detection (lock file specification)

It is possible to parse the lock files of package managers for programming languages such as Gem and pip and detect potential vulnerabilities in the dependent libraries defined in them. (Vuls uses [aquasecurity/trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) internally.)

[Documentation](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#library-vulns-scan).

The following lock files are supported for now.

- Gemfile.lock
- Pipfile.lock
- poetry.lock
- composer.lock
- package-lock.json
- yarn.lock
- Cargo.lock

So let's try scanning [old Redmine Gemfile.lock](https://github.com/41studio/redmine/blob/master/Gemfile.lock) on GitHub.

First, we'll use wget to get the old Gemfile.lock on the scan target server.

```bash
$ # Execute on the scan target server
$ pwd
/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/41studio/redmine/master/Gemfile.lock
```

Specify the path of the lockfiles in config.toml.

```bash
[servers]
[servers.host]
host         = "192.168.56.3"
port        = "22"
user        = "vuls"
keyPath     = "/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
lockfiles = [ "/home/vuls/vulsctl/docker/Gemfile.lock" ]
```

Scan and report.

```bash
$ ./scan.sh hostroot
$ ./report.sh
$ ./tui.sh
```

![library](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/534611/85486162-11538780-b605-11ea-80af-f93222262bf7.png)

---

## CPE Scan.

Vuls can detect vulnerabilities in network devices and commercial middleware by defining [CPE](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) in config.toml. The OS package scan is done by actually SSH into the server and issuing the command. However, the CPE scan is detected by comparing the versions of the NVD and JVN databases. It does not issue commands on the device and does not access the device via a network.

Here's a sample config.toml: `type="pseudo"`.
If `type="pseudo"` is specified, you can change the mode to not connect to SSH.

```bash
[servers.forti]
type = "pseudo"
cpeNames = [
    "cpe:/o:fortinet:fortios:4.3.0",
]
```

Vuls need the NVD and JVN data sources for CPE scan, so use `cve.sh` to get them if they are not already fetched.

```bash
$ ./scan.sh forti
$ ./cve.sh
$ ./report.sh
$ ./tui.sh
```

## Fetch all vulnerable DB

Fetch all Vulnerability DB using [update-all.sh](https://github.com/vulsio/vulsctl/blob/master/docker/update-all.sh).
This will take some time ...

This will take over an hour in my environment.

```bash
$ ./update-all.sh
